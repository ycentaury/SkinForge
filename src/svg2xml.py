# Reverses xml2svg.py: reads back the <metadata id="xml2svg-source"> JSON
# blob (the complete original parsed tree, one entry per screen) that
# xml2svg.py embeds in its output, matches each <rect data-ref=
# "screen_idx:child_idx"> to the element it was drawn from, and - only
# where a box's current on-canvas position/size actually differs from what
# that element originally resolved to - rewrites that element's
# position=/size= to the new concrete pixel values. An element nothing
# touched keeps its original position=/size= exactly as written (including
# any symbolic e/center/%/eval token), so a straight xml2svg -> svg2xml
# round trip with no edits reproduces the source (formatting aside).
#
# Everything the metadata tree carries but xml2svg.py never draws as a box
# - <colors>, <scrollbarstyle>, a <widget>'s own nested <convert> - passes
# through untouched too, since it's part of the same serialized tree.
#
# A rect's x/y/width/height are read relative to its own screen's group
# (data-screen="N", see xml2svg.py) rather than the SVG root - the same
# screen-local space resolveBox() works in - by walking fresh from that
# group with an identity starting matrix, composing in any transform=
# found along the way down to the rect (including one directly on the rect
# itself). That last part matters in practice: Inkscape (and most other
# SVG editors) commonly records a drag or a selection-tool resize as a
# transform="translate(...)" or transform="matrix(...)" added straight
# onto the shape, rather than rewriting its x/y/width/height - a plain
# collectRects() that only reads those attributes would silently ignore
# such an edit. rotate()/skewX()/skewY() aren't meaningful for this tool's
# axis-aligned boxes and are treated as identity with a warning rather than
# applied. The one thing no purely-in-SVG round trip can guard against is
# an editor that flattens a group's transform away entirely on save (bakes
# it into every child and removes the <g>, losing the data-screen anchor);
# a plain drag-and-save doesn't do this, but it's a known limitation.
